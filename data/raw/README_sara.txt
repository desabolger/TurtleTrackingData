As the data we obtained d oes not have any associated metadata file already, weâ€™ll create our own. 

This can include the link from which you obtained the data, the date downloaded, and any other useful information we can provide to allow the user to obtain the same data. Name this file something that obviously links this with the original file, e.g., README_sara.txt.
